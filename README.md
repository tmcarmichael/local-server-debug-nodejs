# NodeJS local server debug tool

(( In progress ))

Intented as a debug tool for REST and eventually GraphQL / gRPC / tRPC protocol.
Mock a server by redirecting it to this local server.

Use Node verison > 19 for node --watch flag. This allows recompiling with saved changes without use of nodemon.
